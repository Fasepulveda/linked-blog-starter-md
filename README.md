My Digital Garden:
----------------------------------------------------------------------
This repository holds all the content for my digital garden, which is built using the linked-blog-starter for Next.js.

What is a Digital Garden?
A digital garden is a place to share knowledge and ideas in a less formal way than a traditional blog. It's a space for learning in public and connecting ideas.

How it Works
All the content is written in Markdown files and stored in this repository.

The linked-blog-starter application reads these Markdown files and renders them as a website.

When changes are pushed to this repository, the website is automatically updated.
